## Summary of 2016's mass shootings:
------------------------------------
There were **`r number.of.shooting`** shooting cases in 2016. If we break it down, the number of lives that were lost during these incidents is **`r number.of.lives.lost`** and the number of people who were injured is **`r number.of.injured`**. The city that is mostly affected by mass shooting in general(lives lost and people injured) is **`r state.and.city.highest.killed`**. In **`r date.for.the.highest.killed`**, **`r state.and.city.highest.killed$city`** experienced the worst shooting in the country. **`r max(mass.shooting.data$killed)`** people were killed & **`r max(mass.shooting.data$injured)`** injured. This cases is related to the 2016's [Orlando Night Club Attack](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36511778).
## Summary Table
----------------
This table shows the number of shooting cases that happened in each state including the number of people injured, killed and the total victims of those shootings.
```{r,message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=TRUE}
# Create a table that has general information on state level.
table <- group_by(mass.shooting.data,state) %>% summarise(total.killed = sum(killed), total.injured = sum(injured), total.victims = (total.injured + total.killed), number.of.cases = n())
state.with.highest.shooting.cases <- table[table$number.of.cases == max(table$number.of.cases),]
oakland <- mass.shooting.data[mass.shooting.data$city=='Oakland',]
kable(table)
```
In 2016, **`r state.with.highest.shooting.cases$state`** had **`r state.with.highest.shooting.cases$number.of.cases`** shooting cases, which is the highest shooting cases recorded in the country. In total, the number of victims were **`r state.with.highest.shooting.cases$total.victims`**, **`r state.with.highest.shooting.cases$total.killed`** killed and **`r state.with.highest.shooting.cases$total.injured`** injured. One example is [Downtown Oakland shooting wounds 8; two men arrested
](http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2016/11/05/oakland-several-wounded-in-downtown-shooting/). This mass shootting happened on **`r oakland$date[1]`**. The incident left **`r max(oakland$injured)`** people injured. Fortunaltlly, no one was killed.

### Map of 2016's shooting in U.S
---------------------------------
`r map`
This map shows the shooting incidents that happened through out the United States in 2016. As indicated, the **majority** of the mass shootings occured in the **southeast** part of the country. This could be due to the strengh of laws and regulations of **firearms** in those states and as well as other factors.
```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=TRUE}
# interactive graph that contains information of the number of victims, number of shooting incidents and
# how many killed and injured by those incidents.
g <- plot_ly(table, x = ~number.of.cases, y = ~total.victims, color = ~total.victims,
size = ~total.victims, text = ~paste("(","# of shootings",", ","# of victims",")"))
```
### Interactive Graph
---------------------
This graph shows the relationship between **number of victims** and the **number of shooting cases** that happened in **2016**. It indicates that as the number of shooting cases **increase** the number of victims also increase. Even though, there are a few places with a few number of shooting cases and a higher number of victims involved.
